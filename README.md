## fractals
Maybe sometimes when I will be bored I will write small programs to vizualize fractals.

### build
It can be built by such shell command:
```shell
g++ filename.cpp -o ofilename -Wall -std=c++11 -O2 -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-graphics
./ofilename # to run
```

### code quality
Right now code is terrible and unreadble but soon I will refactor it. Or you can do it :3.

### Pythagoras tree
First fractal that I wrote ever (even first recursive based vizual program). Every 1.5 seconds it generated new image.

### Cubisn(easy)
Another recursive based fractal. There is nothing interesting, but you can play with constants in begin of program
